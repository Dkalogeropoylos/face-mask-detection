Face Mask Detection Using Faster R-CNN
This repository contains the code and instructions for performing face mask detection using a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model. The goal of this project is to detect whether people in images are wearing face masks and to classify their mask-wearing behavior (with mask, without mask, or mask worn incorrectly).The dataset used for this task contains images of people, along with corresponding XML annotations specifying the location and class label of face masks. The dataset is organized into two folders: images and annotations. The images folder contains the images, and the annotations folder contains XML files with bounding box and label information.Data Preprocessing: You need to preprocess the dataset, convert it into a suitable format, and split it into training and testing subsets. This is typically done by parsing the XML annotations and organizing the data into a format compatible with PyTorch's DataLoader.You'll be using a Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone and FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) architecture. In conclusion, this project demonstrates how to use a Faster R-CNN model for face mask detection. It can be extended for real-world applications such as monitoring compliance with mask-wearing guidelines in public spaces.
